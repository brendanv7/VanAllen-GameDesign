Like the attention to detail in the artwork, the level design, the audio,  and in general, the progress.

Here's some suggestions to improve the game:

1. I gather the PC perspective is top-down. In that case, rather than seeming to slid the PC through the world, animate it, move the arms back and forth.

2. When the PC does something, picks up something, again animate it.

3. In general, the top-down POV is a bit more difficult to seem detail in the PC, especially if the clothing, shoes, etc. are all the same color. Brighten the PC and separate the hat, shirt, etc.
