How to Run:
  - The main program file is escape_the_programming_lab.py. Run this file to
    launch the game.


Known Issues:
  - [BUG] Movement around certain objects can cause the player to be moved to
    odd places due to the collision detection of pygame. This is rare, I've only
    noticed it around the fridge in level 2 and near the tree in level 3.
    (Note: In level 3, go directly up from the tree and then move right after
    picking up the green card or the player is moved off of the screen)

  - [Limitation] Level 3 is the most advanced in terms of graphics and
    animations. I considered adding more to the first 2 levels, but decided that
    would be too much for the Beta. If I were to move forward with this game, I
    would probably start with level 3 as the first level and build from that.

  - [Performance] There is some screen delay at startup before the splash screen
    loads. After some investigation, I came to the conclusion that the most
    likely cause is the pygame engine showing its own limitations.
